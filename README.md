# 30 Days of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the **[30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code)** challenge on HackerRank. Over the course of 30 challenges, I solved coding problems in multiple programming languages to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills.

## Contents

- **Languages Used:**  
  Solutions are implemented in various programming languages to showcase versatility and language-specific techniques:
  - C
  - C++
  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - Perl
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - TypeScript

- **Daily Challenges:**  
  Each day introduces a new concept, ranging from basic to advanced programming topics. Some of the topics covered include:
  - **Day 0 - Day 5:** Basic I/O operations, conditionals, loops, and data types.
  - **Day 6 - Day 10:** Arrays, strings, and dictionaries.
  - **Day 11 - Day 15:** 2D arrays, recursion, and sorting.
  - **Day 16 - Day 20:** Linked lists, stacks, and queues.
  - **Day 21 - Day 25:** Trees, binary search, and graphs.
  - **Day 26 - Day 30:** Advanced topics like dynamic programming, regular expressions, and bit manipulation.

## Folder Structure

Each day's solution is stored in a separate folder labeled with the day number for easy navigation. Inside each folder, solutions are organized by programming language.

Example structure:
```
.
├── Day0 : Hello , World
│   ├── solution.c
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   ├── solution.java
│   ├── solution.js
│   └── solution.pl
│   └── solution.py
│   └── solution.rb
│   ├── solution.ts
├── Day 1 : Data Types
│   ├── solution.c
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   ├── solution.java
│   ├── solution.js
│   └── solution.pl
│   └── solution.py
│   └── solution.rb
│   ├── solution.ts
...
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dsaikiran01/30-days-of-code.git
   cd 30-days-of-code
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired day's solution:**  
   Each day's folder contains code in multiple languages. You can select the appropriate file based on your preferred language.

3. **Run the code:**  
   Use the relevant commands for each language to execute the solutions. For example:
   - **C**: `gcc solution.c -o solution && ./solution`
   - **Cpp**: `g++ solution.cpp -o solution && ./solution`
   - **Python**: `python solution.py`
   - **Java**: `javac Solution.java && java Solution`
   - **JavaScript**: `node solution.js`
   - **Ruby**: `ruby solution.rb`
   - **Perl**: `perl solution.pl`
   - **TypeScript**: `tsc solution.ts && node solution.js`
